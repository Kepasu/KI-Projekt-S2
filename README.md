#### Predicting Wildfires using AI

With the development of our climate the threat of wildfires grows by the day. For our group project in our CS course we decided fight this issue by building a program that can predict upcoming wildfires. 
It utilizes advanced machine learning to make predictions based on decades of weather data.

#### Our Data

To train our machine learning algorithm we decided to use the following datasets:

###### Modis

Modis is a NASA project that uses satellites to detect heat related anomalies on the earths surface. The data ranges from 2000 until today and contains many datapoints useful for our predictions.

###### Carnegie Mellon University

The Carnegie Mellon University from Pittsburgh, Philadelphia has a very extensive collection of historic weather data. The data is collected from weather stations in 210 US cities and contains weather information up to 150 years old.
